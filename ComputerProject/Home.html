<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
<p>
If you want to get ahead into a career in the professions you should consider doing work placements or internships within the sector you are interested in. It's a good idea to start early - don't wait until you graduate to gain experience: the jobs market is competitive and by showing your commitment as soon as you can, you will stand out.

Work placements and internships give you the opportunity to develop relevant skills, knowledge and experience while getting firsthand experience of life in a real working environment. 

Be creative when thinking about work placements - use your contacts; take a look at the professional body for your sector, and see what opportunities they offer; use your holidays wisely by putting some time aside for gaining experience as well as enjoying time off.
